**Report on FastAPI Development**

**1. Introduction:**

In this report, we address the development of an API using the FastAPI framework in Python. The main objective was to create an API to provide access to a user's most recent tweets, with API key-based authentication. The project was developed to demonstrate the creation of a simple yet functional API and its automatic documentation using Swagger UI.

**2. Methods:**

- **Project Structure**: The project was structured into two main files, `main.py` and `app.py`. The `app.py` file contained the application logic, including the definition of API endpoints using FastAPI. The `main.py` file contained the code to initialize the UVicorn server and start the application.

- **API Development**: We successfully developed a functional API using FastAPI. We implemented endpoints to retrieve a user's most recent tweets, with support for query parameters such as limit and offset. We also implemented API key-based authentication using request headers.

- **Automatic Documentation**: FastAPI provides automatic API documentation using Swagger UI. The documentation is generated dynamically based on the endpoints, parameters, and models defined in the application.

**3. Results:**

- We successfully developed a functional API using FastAPI.
- We implemented endpoints to retrieve a user's most recent tweets, with API key-based authentication.
- Automatic documentation of the API using Swagger UI was generated and was accessible at `/docs`.

**4. Conclusion:**

The use of FastAPI significantly simplified the process of developing APIs in Python. It provides a clean and expressive syntax, making it easy to define endpoints and handle HTTP requests. Additionally, the automatic documentation generated by Swagger UI is extremely useful for developers and users of the API, providing an easy way to understand and test the available endpoints.

**5. Case Study:**

Imagine a social media analytics company that wants to develop an application to monitor their clients' tweet activity. They can use the API developed in this project to access users' most recent tweets and analyze their content, trends, and sentiments. They can set up a system to periodically call the API for updates and store the data in a database for further analysis. With the automatic documentation provided by Swagger UI, they can easily understand how to use the API and integrate it into their social media analytics application.


# Documentação da API

Esta é a documentação para a minha API. Para executá-la localmente, siga as instruções abaixo.

## Como executar a aplicação localmente

1. Clone o repositório:

2. Navegue até o diretório do projeto:

3. Instale as dependências:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Inicie o servidor:
```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
A aplicação estará em execução localmente em `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
